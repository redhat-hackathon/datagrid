# Red Hat DataGrid for Distributed Caching

## What is it?

Red Hat Data Grid is a in-memory, distributed, NoSQL datastore solution (cache). Data Grid decreases application response times and allows developers to dramatically improve performance while providing availability, reliability, and elastic scale.

Data Grid is fully compatible with your existing data tier and provides platform-independent access to applications through tested and secure APIs such as HotRod and REST. This eliminates the challenges and costs of traditional database integration and streamlines the ability of developers to deploy new applications.

Find [more details about Data Grid](https://developers.redhat.com/products/datagrid/overview) on our Red Hat developers page.
